# DollarOne-Studio [WIP]

Project for creating a collection of shapes and test them with $1 Unistroke Recognizer (http://depts.washington.edu/aimgroup/proj/dollar/index.html)

The goals of this project are:
* Have the possibility to generate an exportable database of shapes.
* Test all project shapes separately or all at the same time.
* Export all project shapes separately or all at the same time, to different $1 libraries (languages). (**only c++ implementation for now**)

**Advise:** that's an internal tool we use as a supporting feature for some of our projects, so the code was writen fast and it's not clean/optimized at all... so don't hold it against us :)
